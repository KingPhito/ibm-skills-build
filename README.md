# IBM SkillsBuild Portfolio

This repository contains the projects and exercises that my teams and I have completed as part of the IBM SkillsBuild program. The projects are organized by the course they belong to.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Anaconda and use the following commands to create a new environment from the requirements.txt file
This will ensure that you have all the necessary packages installed in the new environment:

    ```
    %conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
    %conda activate <env>
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks
